##About me:
- Data scientist at Aurora Cannabis in the Business Intelligence and Analytics department with focus analytics and advanced analytics(developing and deploying enterprise data science solutions).     
- Prior to joining Aurora, I was in the biotech and molecular diagnostics field developing and validating biomarkers and genomic classifiers in urological oncology. 
- BSc - CMPT & Microbiology/biochemistry from SFU.      
- At Vancouver Datajam 2020, I will be teaching an introductory workshop on decision trees and random forest and leading a team.    
- Pronouns: he/him.

### Advanced R workshop   
- Mainly using R 
- This workshop will be focused on Decision Trees and Random Forest
- Assuming some stats background and geared towards advanced R users
- Assuming knoweldge of Train/Test splits
- Assuming knoweldge of Model Evaluation (metrics)

# What is Data Science?

- Data Analytics, Data Mining, Stats, Big Data, **ML**, Predictive Analytics?
- Data Science is: making sense of Data
- Data Science is: multidisciplinary (Stats, Math, CS, Domain Experts)


## Data Science Lifecycle
- Cross-industry standard process for data mining, known as CRISP-DM

#TDSP
###The Team Data Science Process (TDSP) is an agile, iterative data science methodology to deliver predictive analytics solutions and intelligent applications efficiently

## Machine Learning

* According to Arthur Samuel, Machine Learning algorithms enable the computers to **learn from data**, and even improve themselves, without being explicitly programmed.
                         
### Types of Machine Learning:    
* Supervised Learning       
    -  Classification (spam or not spam; disease or not)    
    -  Regression (value for dollars or weight)     
* Unsupervised Learning          
    -  Clustering (inheret grouping in data)    
    -  Association (rules describing your data; people that buy X also tend to buy Y)    
* Reinforcement Learning         
A reinforcement learning algorithm, or agent, learns by interacting with its environment.
## Common Examples

-  Classification and class probability estimation: Cancer or Benign?
-  Regression: How much will you use the service?
-  Similarity Matching: Recommender systems/similarity
-  Clustering: Can you find natural groups in your data set?
## Applications of Data Science
- Fraud and Risk Detection
- Healthcare
- Internet Search
- Targeted Advertising
- Website Recommendations
- Advanced Image Recognition
- Speech Recognition
- Airline Route Planning
- Gaming
- Augmented Reality
- Sales forecast

## Deployment

#### Won't focus on this right now


Some examples - Deployments depends on the application:
- Machine Learning Server in MS SQL 2017 (R&Python; Cloud (VM) and on-prem)
- Containers and Orchestration (Docker/Keubernetes and Aks)
- cortex.dev (AWS, Docker and EKS)
- ML Ops (Azure)
- Databricks

# Data Science Hype

- Lack of clear definition
- Hype is crazy and data science is a hot market - some people throwing phrases as if data science is Master of Universe
- Data science is not just a rebranding of statistics or machine learning but rather a field unto itself
- “Anything that has to call itself a science isn’t.”

## Getting Past the Hype

### Why Now?
- massive amounts of data
- growing influence of data in most sectors and most industries
